  <p>Candyblrd opinion about upcoming world war 3</p>

  <p>So today's topic, we're gonna talk about World War 3, or what it will be called soon. The reason I talk about this topic in this blog is because of the policy of all those social media platforms. If I talk in here that it was my own website, no one can take it down except governments, and GitHub, that which this website was written. So let's start !
	It all starts with the war between Russia and Ukraine from the Crimean land conflict. And then there's the Israel and Palestine conflict that started a while back, around 20 years ago, that became hot again. And right now, 22 June 2025, there's a new conflict between Israel and Iran that is so bad that many other academicians thought this would be the start of a new world war. There would be 2 teams like the previous world wars. The leaders of the 2 opposite sides would be Russia and the United States. Iran, North Korea, China, and Pakistan would probably be on the Russian side. While Israel will be on America's side. For the EU, we are not sure yet what side they would choose because of the previous tariff set by Donald Trump, President of the United States. If this war gets hotter and hotter, we might face a nuclear war, which is very bad because that would mean billions would be dead, the atmosphere would be completely covered with radioactive substances. The world technologies would set back a whole lot. As someone once said, “I don’t know what weapon will be used for World War 3, but I know in World War 4 we will fight with sticks and rocks,” as it means that our world will be destroyed so badly. I hope this conflict will cool down, even a little bit would be good because it will affect me, “candybird” too. Because right now I'm 15 years old. That means if it happens soon. The education system would be paused. The economy would collapse and maybe send them to war and die like those from World War 1 and 2 that who sent young people around 18 years old to fight and die. If it starts there, won't be any winners; we would all be lost. The world we live in would be like a mountain of ashes.I hope it ends soon, and goodbye.
